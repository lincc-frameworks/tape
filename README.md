The **Time series Analysis and Processing Engine** (TAPE) is a framework for distributed time series analysis which enables the user to scale their algorithms to large datasets, created to work towards the goal of making [LSST](https://www.lsst.org/about) time series analysis accessible. It allows for efficient and scalable evaluation of algorithms on time domain data through built-in fitting and analysis methods as well as support for user-provided algorithms. TAPE supports ingestion of multiple time series formats, enabling easy access to both LSST time series objects and data from other astronomical surveys.

In short term we are working on two main goals of the project:
  - Enable efficient and scalable evaluation of algorithms on time-domain data
  - Enable ease of access to time-domain data in LSST

This is a LINCC Frameworks project - find more information about LINCC Frameworks [here](https://www.lsstcorporation.org/lincc/frameworks).

To learn about the usage of the package, consult the [Documentation](https://tape.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html).

## Installation
TAPE is available to install with pip, using the "lf-tape" package name:
``` 
pip install lf-tape
```
