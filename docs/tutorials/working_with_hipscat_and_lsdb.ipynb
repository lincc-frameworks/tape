This package uses dask to parallelize operations across multiple HiPSCat partitioned surveys.\n",
    "\n",
    "Both HiPSCat and LSDB are strong tools in the arsenal of a TAPE user. HiPSCat provides a scalable data format for working at the scale of LSST. While LSDB provides tooling to prepare more complex datasets for TAPE analysis, including operations like cross-matching multiple surveys, cone searches to select data from specific regions of the sky, etc. In this notebook, we'll walk through the process by which these can be used with TAPE."
