One such example being the \"Lazy\" execution discussed in the [\"Working with the tape Ensemble object\"](https://tape.readthedocs.io/en/latest/tutorials/working_with_the_ensemble.html) notebook, where specific lines of code are not automatically run at execution time, and instead are added to a scheduler and await a signal to run the calculation.

The Distributed Client enables asynchronous computation, where Dask's `compute` and `persist` methods are able to run in the background and persist in memory while we continue doing other work.\n",

Partitioning allows data to be read into memory in manageable chunks.  \n",

Alternatively, we could have supplied `n_partitions` to specify a target number of output partitions. \n",

The consequence of this is that operations on a single lightcurve now need to access multiple partitions, which adds significant data shuffling costs to your workflow. If your timeseries is split across multiple partitions, you'll also want to explicitly set `use_map=False` in `Ensemble.batch` calls, as otherwise it will use `Dask` [map_partitions](https://docs.dask.org/en/stable/generated/dask.dataframe.DataFrame.map_partitions.html) which will only operate on the lightcurve data it sees in each partition!"
