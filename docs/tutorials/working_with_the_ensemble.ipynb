This borrows from the Rubin Observatories object-source convention, where object denotes a given astronomical object and source is the collection of measurements of that object. Essentially, the Object frame stores one-off information about objects, and the source frame stores the available time-domain data. As a result, `Ensemble` functions that operate on the underlying dataframes need to be pointed at either object or source. In most cases, the default is the object table as it's a more helpful interface for understanding the contents of the `Ensemble`, especially when dealing with large volumes of data.\n",
