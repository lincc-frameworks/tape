    "`Ensemble.batch` is a versatile function that allows users to pass in external functions that operate on groupings of `Ensemble` data, most commonly these are functions that calculate something per lightcurve. Because external functions can have a huge variety of inputs and outputs, this notebook serves as a collection of example functions and how `batch` can be used with them. The hope is that there is a function here similar to a function that you are trying to apply via `batch` so that example can be used as a template for getting your function to work."
